## E-Commerce App

# Description:
A web application for e-commerce functionality that includes user authentication, and a shopping cart feature.

The app features user authentication, route protection, and an interactive UI with Lottie animations.

    Lottie Animations: Interactive and smooth animations have been added using Lottie for an enhanced UI experience.

    Toast Notifications: react-hot-toast is used for showing success and error messages.

    Formik for Form Validation: Form validation is managed with Formik and Yup for easier form handling and validation rules.

# Design Decisions

    State Management:
        Context API is used to manage global state for authentication (AuthContext) and cart management (CartContext). This approach makes the state accessible throughout the app without prop drilling.

    Routing:
        React Router (react-router-dom) is used for navigation between pages. It allows seamless transitions between pages like login, register, products, and cart.

    User Feedback:
        react-hot-toast is used for toasts to notify the user of success, errors, or actions like adding/removing products from the cart or completing a purchase.

    UI/UX:
        Tailwind CSS is used to style the application. It provides utility-first CSS classes to design responsive and flexible UIs.
        Lottie animations are used to enhance user experience, particularly in the cart page to display an empty cart animation.
        Buttons and interactive elements are visually enhanced using Tailwindâ€™s hover and focus classes to improve accessibility and responsiveness.

    Protected Routes:
        The app uses a custom ProtectedRoute component to ensure users cannot access the cart page without being logged in.
        Users who are not logged in are redirected to the login page when trying to access these routes.

# Special Features

    Lottie Animations:
    Lottie animations are used on the cart page and product page to show an animation when the cart is empty or when no product is found. This adds a fun and engaging element to the user experience.

    Form Validation with Formik & Yup:
    Formik is used for handling forms and state management of form inputs. This simplifies complex form validation, especially for login and registration forms, with Yup schema validation for easier setup and maintenance.

    Responsive Design:
    The app is built with responsive design in mind using Tailwind CSS. It adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring that the app is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

    React Router Dom:
    React Router is used for handling navigation and routing between pages. The app includes routes for login, registration, products, cart.
